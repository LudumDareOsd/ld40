## Ludum Dare 40 - "The more you have, the worse it is"

https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/carnage

[This game might not be suited for children. It contains animated violence, blood and gore.]

We are the new gladiators. Our world is fire and blood. Once, I was a cop. A road warrior hunting the outlaws. As the world fell, each of us in our own way was broken. PRIVATE CORPORATIONS run all correctional facilities for profit. Food and life is scarce. Now I fight for survival, I fight for **MEAT**! I am **CARnage**!

Welcome to enjoy an adrenaline filled top-down car racing game inspired by old school games like Death Rally and Death Race and movies like Mad Max. Will you be able to finish the race before your opponents? Or will you have to starve yet again...?

Finish the number of laps needed by the level before your opponents. Try to get a high score. Pick up the power-ups to help you along your battles.

You'll have to finish first to be able to continue and call you a "winner". Run over pedestrians to get a higher kill-count. But watch out, a hit also increases your Gore-O-Meter. The higher it goes the slower your car will go... How many kills do you dare to get?

Controls: Keyboard or Gamepad
- Left: Left arrow OR a
- Right: Right arrow OR d
- Thrust: Up arrow OR w [Gamepad A]
- Reverse: Down arrow OR s [Gamepad X]
- Use power-up: Space [Gamepad B]

Power-ups:
- Nos: makes you go faster for a couple of seconds
- Car wash: wash your car to bring down the Gore-O-Meter and thus making you go faster again

Use the boost lanes to go faster!
Don't cheat! You have to go thru all checkpoints to win...
